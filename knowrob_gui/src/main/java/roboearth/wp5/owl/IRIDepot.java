/**
 * 
 * The IRIDepot is a central place, where the IRIs of all used classes and properties are stored.
 * As they are abbreviated IRIs, they are intended to be used in conjunction with the prefix manager
 * given in this class as well. The central storage helps to avoid unexpected behavior due to
 * typographic errors. If an entity would have to be renamed, it only has to be done once in this 
 * class.
